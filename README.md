# SentryFeed ðŸ“µ

Control your LinkedIn/X feed with an LLM of your choice. A chrome extension that filters out cringe content (engagement click-bait, promotional content, and low-value off-topic posts etc) on your LinkedIn/X feed. It uses AI to analyse LinkedIn/X posts in real time and hides cringe worthy content.

This prototype demonstrates how AI can empower us to have more control over the content we consume.


## How it works?

The SentryFeed Chrome extension filters out cringe content from your LinkedIn/X feed using an AI model. When you browse LinkedIn:

1. **Detects New Posts**: As new posts appear in your feed, the extension detects them in real time.
2. **Sends for Analysis**: The post content is sent to an AI model (via an API) that classifies it based on predefined "cringe" criteria (e.g., engagement bait, overly promotional content, etc.).
3. **Applies Blur**: Posts identified as cringe are blurred to keep your feed cleaner and more relevant.
4. **User Control**: Users can customize the types of posts they want to see and hide, and control their settings (like 
API keys) via modifying `content.js`.

## Running SentryFeed Locally
