**Privacy Policy**  
Effective Date: 26th Feb 2025  

**Data Collection**  
SentryFeed does not collect, store, or share any personal data. The extension processes LinkedIn/X posts in real-time within your browser to determine whether they match filtering criteria. No user data, login credentials, or browsing history is collected.  

**API Usage**  
When you use SentryFeed:  
- The content of LinkedIn/X posts is sent to Groq's API for analysis to determine relevance.  
- Your API key is stored locally in your browser and is never transmitted elsewhere.  
- The extension does not store or retain any analyzed data after processing.  

**Third-Party Services**  
SentryFeed relies on Groq's API to analyze LinkedIn/X posts and classify content based on filtering rules. We do not control how Groq handles data, so we encourage you to review [Groq's privacy policy](https://groq.com/privacy-policy/) for details on their data processing practices.  

**Permissions Justification**  
- **activeTab**: Needed to analyze and modify the LinkedIn feed in real-time.  
- **storage**: Used to save user preferences, such as filtering settings and API configurations.  
- **host permissions (linkedin.com, x.com)**: Required to read and process LinkedIn/X content for filtering purposes.  

**Security Measures**  
- The extension does not execute remote code or store external scripts.  
- API interactions are limited to filtering LinkedIn content; no other browsing data is sent or processed.  
- All user preferences remain stored locally within the browser.
